# 10xclick.sys ‚Äî Windows Mouse Click Multiplication Filter Driver

**Author:** [Amr Hamail]  
**Type:** Windows Kernel-Mode WDM Filter Driver  
**Purpose:** Multiply physical mouse left-click events at the kernel level by synthesizing fake IRPs.  
**Status:** In Development ‚Äî Functional Prototype.

## üöÄ Overview

`10xclick.sys` is a Windows kernel-mode filter driver designed to multiply mouse left-click events in real time. By injecting synthesized `MOUSE_INPUT_DATA` structures directly into the HID class stack, this driver intercepts raw mouse input and triggers additional "fake" left clicks ‚Äî amplifying a single hardware click up to 5 times (10 total clicks: down-up pairs).  

This project was built entirely from scratch, using the Windows Driver Model (WDM) ‚Äî not the more modern KMDF ‚Äî for full manual control over IRP stack manipulation, completion handling, and precise timing behavior.

It was developed not as an academic assignment or company deliverable, but as a pure passion project by someone obsessed with how Windows handles low-level input.

## üîß Technical Highlights

- **Filter Driver Architecture:** Attaches to the HID mouse stack to intercept and duplicate `IRP_MJ_READ` requests.
- **IRP Stack Cloning:** Utilizes `IoCopyCurrentIrpStackLocationToNext`, `IoCallDriver`, and custom completion routines to safely propagate and re-inject synthesized IRPs.
- **Input Injection:** Creates new `MOUSE_INPUT_DATA` structs directly in kernel space, modifying only the `ButtonFlags` and injecting sequences of click-down/up events.
- **Stack Safety:** Handles IRQL and stack constraints with care ‚Äî including `IoSetCompletionRoutine` to ensure injected IRPs don‚Äôt leak or crash.
- **Multiplication Cap:** Multiplication factor limited to 5 injected click pairs to avoid overwhelming the I/O manager or risking input handler instability.
- **Built in Under 12 Hours:** This was a focused, intense build. Every hour went into getting one thing right: raw input manipulation at the deepest level Windows allows.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **Not production-grade** ‚Äî intended for testing, experimentation, and driver development practice only.
- **No symbolic link or IOCTL interface** ‚Äî click multiplication factor is currently hardcoded and capped.
- **Multiplication cap** ‚Äî 5 pairs max (10 clicks total) per event for safety and predictability.
- **No digital signature** ‚Äî must disable driver signature enforcement to load on modern Windows versions.
- **Tested in VM environments only.**

## üìö Why WDM?

Choosing WDM over KMDF was deliberate. WDM requires you to manually manage every step ‚Äî from IRP propagation to memory cleanup to device stack handling. It's harder, riskier, and more error-prone ‚Äî but it teaches you exactly how Windows internals behave when input flows from a mouse to a kernel stack.

For `10xclick.sys`, I wanted that control. I wanted to see what would happen when I intercepted a read request and created my own.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository and open the `.sln` in Visual Studio.
2. Use the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) with kernel-mode support.
3. Set configuration to **Release** and **x64**.
4. Compile. The `.sys` file will appear in the output directory.

## üì¶ Installation (Test Signing Only)

1. Enable test mode:  
   `bcdedit /set testsigning on`  
   Restart your machine.

2. Use tools like OSR Loader or `sc` to install and load `10xclick.sys`.

3. Ensure you're attaching it above the HID mouse class driver (usually `mouclass.sys`).

## üôè A Note From the Author

This project was born from obsession, not obligation. I didn't build `10xclick.sys` to solve a business problem ‚Äî I built it because I *had to know* if I could. Every detail was hand-written: the IRP stack logic, the injected data structs, even the limits to keep the system stable.

## üß† Future Plans

- IOCTL interface to configure click multiplier in real time
- GUI companion controller for injection toggling
- URB-level injection for USB HID devices
- KMDF port with structured memory safety
